# React Shopping Cart with Restock Feature

## Description
This shopping cart app displays a list of products, which can be added to the cart or removed from the cart. A "checkout" feature displays the total price, based on the items currently in the cart. Products can be restocked by clicking a button with makes a call to a Strapi API and getting more products from a database.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
When products are restocked, if a product is already in stock, update the "instock" count rather than adding a new (duplicate) item
